Quantitative Reasoning Reflection



1.
In this class we used different quantitative methods, techniques and algorithms
that all added functionality to our programs. When we had large portions of
code, it was easier for me to break it into smaller portions,so I could
understand how the code worked. When it came to deciding on what method to use,
it was all about what type of program you were making like if the code was going to
show a picture, run a game, or do something on the number side of things(selection
and insertion sorting).


- if have a large portion of code, break it into smaller portions so it wil be easier to understand
and figure out the code





2.

- naming the variable well so others can understand what it does
- naming functions well
- clear comments to show what is happening for this portion of code or what this code is for
- line spacing
- group similar code together
- comments with step by step instructions




3. - run code and test to see if the result is correct
- if code wrong, make small changes to try something new
- keep track of changes so know what works and doesn't work
- for example if the game is running and there isn't anything wrong then the code works
and your program is running correct




4. - stats doesn't show everything like in sports
- algorithms either works or doesn't (all right or all wrong)
- algorithms can be more accurate
- Some students are the best at testing and more of hands on learning
- Some students might perform better in the classroom with testing while others perform better
in the real world (working)
- Some teachers might teach certain ways that do not work for many students, but they are still a smart
person that knows the material.
